        - Create a new Firestore database .
        - In the Firebase Console, go to Prject Setting . 
        - Service account and then Generate new private key . 
        - Use the following command in the directory folder where you have backup file and genereted key
       ```bash
        bashCopy code
        npx -p node-firestore-import-export firestore-import -a <genereted key file here> -b <backfile here>
    
        ```

## **Running the App**

1. Connect your device or set up an emulator.
2. Run the app using the following command:

    ```bash
